# Is it ready yet, Netflix??

Here's a little demo app of the Jigsaw Stack API in action. Just take a look at the [isitdoneyet.ts](isitdoneyet.ts) file for the meat of the code.

To run this code yourself just add a `.env` file with the following content:

```
JIGSAW_API_KEY=your-api-key
```

Then `deno run -A isitdoneyet.ts` and you're good to go!
